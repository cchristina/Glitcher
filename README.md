# Glitcher
Hackbright Project

Glitche takes inspiration from glitch art and Conway's Game of Life. Users can select up to two images from a gallery (or upload some of their own) and run through one of three glitches (with more to come) which are implemented with Python Image Library and by editing binary files. Instead of just a static output, the glitched and the original are combined with a simulation of Game of Life, and then user can then step through the generations or let them run automatically. The results are visually interesting, fun images formed from an intersection of rules and randomness.
